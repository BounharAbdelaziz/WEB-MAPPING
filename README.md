# WEB-MAPPING
Web application (under Angular 7 and Java EE SpringBoot) for monitoring the expropriation of land in Morocco

Please make sure to run 'npm install' before runing 'ng serve'. You need to install the npm module before that so please make sure to run 'npm install' when you want to start the server

You will also need PostgreSQL installed, please make sure to create a database in it and change the name of it and the passeword in the 'application.properties' file, when running the backend part, it will automaticaly create the tables for you.

In my case, I used as a database name : mapping, databaseusername : postgres and database password : root
